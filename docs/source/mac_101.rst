MAC 101: An Introduction
==========================

This is an introduction to the things that you should know about 
your new Mac.

In this section we discuss how to properly setup your Mac, how 
to SSH onto a remote computer, and more.

SSH

For most of the research being done in graduate school, one needs 
to access a remote computer that have more processors, more disk space 
than your computer. For this, you can **SSH** onto a remote 
computer via the terminal.

In order to do that, you first need to do the following in the terminal

* **SSH folder**

.. code::

    $ cd $HOME
    $ mkdir .ssh
    $ chmod 700 .ssh

* **SSH Configuration file**

.. code::

    $ cd ~/.ssh
    $ touch config
    $ chmod 600 config

* **Authorized_keys file**

.. code::

    $ cd ~/.ssh
    $ touch authorized_keys
    $ chmod 700 authorized_keys

* **Connections Folder**

.. code::

    cd ~/.ssh
    mkdir connections
    chmod 700 connections

* **SSH-Keys Folder**

.. code::

    cd ~/.ssh
    mkdir ssh_keys
    chmod 700 ssh_keys

* **Public Keys Folder**

.. code::

    cd ~/.ssh
    mkdir pub_keys
    chmod 700 pub_keys

At this point, your :code:`~/.ssh` folder should look like this:

.. code::

    $ ls -lah ~/.ssh

    drwx------    8 user  staff   256B Jan 21 18:37 ./
    drwxr-xr-x@ 161 user  staff   5.0K Jan 21 20:24 ../
    -rw-------@   9 user  staff   288B Jan 21 18:37 authorized_keys
    -rw-------@   1 user  staff   1.4K Jan 21 19:03 config
    drwx------    2 user  staff    64B Jan 22 16:37 connections/
    drwx------    2 user  staff    64B Jan 22 16:37 pub_keys/
    drwx------    2 user  staff    64B Jan 22 16:37 ssh_keys/

Now you can access a remote computer by logging in from the terminal:

.. code::

    ssh username@123456.server.io

The tedious thing about this is that it will prompt you for 
your password anytime that you want to access the remote server.

This can be solved by using **:code:`SSH keys`**.


^^^^^^^^^^^^^
SSH-Keys
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some servers are configured to accept encryption keys in addition 
to (or instead of) requiring a password. This can be more secure 
since the account cannot be compromised by someone guessing passwords!

SSH keys are comprised of a **public** and a **private** key. The public 
key can be given to anyone (hence the name). If you connect to a server 
that has your public key and you can provide your private key, it will 
let you in. (Consequently, if your private key is **stolen**, 
someone else can log into your account!)

In order to **generate SSH keys**, you need to run the following:

.. code:: bash

    $ cd ~/.ssh
    $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
    $ Generating public/private rsa key pair.
    Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/calder/.ssh/id_rsa): id_rsa_4096
    Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
    Enter same passphrase again:
    $ ls
    id_rsa_4096
    id_rsa_4096.pub
    $ chmod 600 id_rsa*
    $ mv id_rsa_4096 ssh_keys/
    $ mv id_rsa_4096.pub pub_keys

Now you can add your **SSH-Keys** by typing the following:

.. code::

    ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/ssh_keys/*

.. note::

    The argument :code:`-K` in :code:`ssh-add` for adding the key to your 
    **Keychain** if you are on a MacOSX system. If not, just have the command 
    :code:`ssh-add ~/.ssh/ssh_keys/*` to add all of the SSH-KEYS that you 
    have created.

From now on, you should add the **private** keys and their respective **public**
keys to the :code:`ssh_keys` and :code:`pub_keys` folders, and then run the 
commands :code:`chmod 600 key` and :code:`chmod 600 key.pub` command, 
replacing :code:`key` with the name of the actual SSH-key.

.. note::

    If you enter a passpharase, you will need to type that password every time 
    you use the ssh keys (e.g. when connecting to a server). It's common to not 
    create a password, but know that if the private key is lost, anyone can use 
    them. (But they would have to know which server to connect to, which 
    "config" file will provide!)

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
SSH Config file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This file acts as the file with predefined options for how you connect
to numerous SSH servers.

After having created the :code:`config` file in the :code:`~/.ssh` directory,
you must add the information to each of the servers that you connect to.

First, you must execute

.. code::

    open ~/.ssh/config

in order to open the :code:`~/.ssh/config` file.
After having opened the file, you can add **global** settings for how 
each SSH sessions executes.
Add these lines to your :code:`config` file:

.. code::

    Host *
    ControlMaster auto
    ControlPath ~/.ssh/connections/%C
    ControlPersist 1m
    ServerAliveInterval 30
    ServerAliveCountMax 10

If you're on a **MAC** and would like to use X11 as well, add 
**these extra lines** beneath :code:`ServerAliveCountMax`:

.. code::

    XAuthLocation /opt/X11/bin/xauth
    AddKeysToAgent yes
    UseKeychain yes

This will ensure that your connections don't die, forward X11, and 
save those keys to your **Keychain** (if applicable).

""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Connecting to Github
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Once you have your :code:`~/.ssh/config` file setup, you can add your 
**Github** information to it.

You would just need to add this below the code from above:

.. code-block:: bash

    Host github.com
    HostName github.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/ssh_keys/github_key
    IdentitiesOnly yes
    PreferredAuthentications publickey

This will make **git** to use the public key :code:`github_key`, which 
you should have created already. If not, follow these instructions
`here <https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/>`_.

""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Forwarding X11 (MACs only)
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

If you happen to plot on remote servers, you might want to use XQuarts (X11)
if you're on a Mac in order to plot. If so, you will need to add 
the following line to the :code:`~/.ssh/config` file below the **Host** 
information for the server.

.. code::

    ForwardX11 yes

And make sure that the :code:`XAuthLocation` setting is pointing to the 
correct path of :code:`xauth`. This will guarantee that you don't a problem 
with rerouting your plots to X11. For more information, see 
`XQuartz <https://www.xquartz.org/>`_.


Your :code:`~/.ssh/config` file should look something like this now:

.. code::

    Host *
    ControlMaster auto
    ControlPath ~/.ssh/connections/%C
    ControlPersist 1m
    ServerAliveInterval 30
    ServerAliveCountMax 10
    XAuthLocation /opt/X11/bin/xauth
    AddKeysToAgent yes
    UseKeychain yes

    ## Connects to a remote Server via SSH
    Host server_name
    HostName path.to.server
    User username
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/ssh_keys/server_key
    IdentitiesOnly yes
    PreferredAuthentications publickey
    ForwardX11 yes

where :code:`server` is the name of the *server* to which you want to 
connect, and :code:`path.to.server` is the URL to the server. This will 
use the :code:`~/.ssh/ssh_keys/server_key` SSH key to access the server
with your credentials for username :code:`username`.
