For most of the research being done in graduate school, one needs 
to access a remote computer that have more processors, more disk space 
than your computer. For this, you can **SSH** onto a remote 
computer via the terminal.

In order to do that, you first need to do the following in the terminal

* Create the new SSH folder

.. code::

    $ cd $HOME
    $ mkdir .ssh
    $ chmod 700 .ssh

* SSH Configuration file

.. code::

    $ cd ~/.ssh
    $ touch config
    $ chmod 600 config

* Authorized_keys file

.. code::

    $ cd ~/.ssh
    $ touch authorized_keys
    $ chmod 700 authorized_keys

* Connections Folder

.. code::
    $ cd ~/.ssh
    $ mkdir connections
    $ chmod 700 connections
