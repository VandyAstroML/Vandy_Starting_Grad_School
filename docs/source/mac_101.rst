For most of the research being done in graduate school, one needs 
to access a remote computer that have more processors, more disk space 
than your computer. For this, you can **SSH** onto a remote 
computer via the terminal.

In order to do that, you first need to do the following in the terminal

.. code::

    ## Creating new SSH folder
    % cd $HOME
    % mkdir .ssh
    % chmod 700 .ssh
    ## SSH Configuration file
    % cd .ssh
    % touch config
    % chmod 600 config
    ## Authorized_keys file
    % touch authorized_keys
    % chmod 700 authorized_keys
    ## Connections Folder
    % mkdir connections
    % chmod 700 connections
