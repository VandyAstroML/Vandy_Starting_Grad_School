The idea of machine learning (ML) is not new, but ML has become a tool
that many astronomers are using at their analysis.

It has been used to:

- Predict the *photometric redshifts* of distant galaxies
- Determine HI richness of galaxies
- Classify galaxy morphologies, i.e. *ellipticals*, *disky*, *barred*, etc.
- and many other applications.
  
Machine learning has definitely started to change the field of astronomy 
and astrophysics. This is the reason for why it is important to 
properly understand how to get the best results for a ML project.

There are two main types of ML algorithms, i.e. **supervised** and 
**unsupervised**. The first type is mainly used for *classification* problems,
while the second one is mainly used for *clustering* problems.

**Supervised** machine learning refers to the *prediction* of 
labels (**`classification`**) or values (**`regression`**) based on a 
*previous* knowledge of the data, i.e. the user know the *truth* of 
each observation, and tries to make an educated guess of for 
unobserved data based on a **training** process with data.
