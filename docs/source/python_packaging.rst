Python Packaging - Building your own module
================================================

Each project requires its own different functions, definitions, etc.
But most of the times, you will be recycling over old code over and over,
and you will have many duplicates of the same code laying around.

This is why it's important to know how to **build your own python module**.

This is a small tutorial on how to property setup your module, and 
about some of the **very useful** tools that you can use in order to 

- Test your module for errors (Travis CI)
- Keep your documentation up to date (ReadTheDocs)
- and more.
